// Time Complexity :
// it is a fuction can be any number 
// denoted by O as most higher value we denote that as a O

// common complexities:
//O(1): constant
// number of operation means what want to print under console
// given input in array , string 
// in O(n) input mean nothing as we only focus on operation if the input is 100 ele and operation is "hello world" so our num of operation will not increare
// in this fun performing one operation "hello world"  O(n)
// straight line isconstant

//O(n) : linear
// mostly in loop 
// mostly in linear search which meaans searching every element of arraay , string would be 1000


//imp note : if we hae two complexity O(n) and O(1)
// we choose bigger one which is O(n)
//always big numis worst timw complexity as it take high time



// O(n*2): Quandratic
// nested loop mostly found
// metrix 


//O(logn):  O(logn)>>O(n),,, O(nlogn)>>>O(n^2)
// binary search moostly found(in binary search we devided ourarray till getting thenum)
// good time complexity log n
// O(n) we an convert in this means its good

// O(nlogn):
// sorting found
// 

//O(2*n) == 3*n 4*n ll same
// recursion 
// base = branches 

// O(n!)
// permutation 
// worst


//problem solving:
// 1s~~10*8 operation
// 10*8 operation done in 1s.
// TL means for running code is in 1s is better for 10*8 operation in worst case
